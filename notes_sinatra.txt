# notes for sinatra: 

http: hypertext transfer protocol
	- allows communication over the internet bw clients and servers
	- client will request a resource from server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client. 
	- this response contains a status code, and the requested resource (usually a web page)

	these are sent via http. 

sinatra is a ruby application in 2000 LOC. 
	good study to understand how it works, and understand ruby better. 

sinatra is build on top of Rack > which is a low-level interface that communicates bw/ an http server and a ruby object. 

(other riby web frameworks: rails, ramaze, rango, camping, halcyon)

## if you can build it in ruby, you can make it into a sinatra app. 
is this ^ statement true?

## only the last line is evaluated and sent to the browser. (the line before 'end' that is)

## restarting the server after every change to existing files can be tiresome, so it's worth it to use Sinatra::Reloader which is part of the Sinatra::Contrib library. 

>> to use Sinatra::Reloader, install the sinatra-contrib gem.

# ^ this route contains a named parameter, called :name, signified
# by the leading colon. 

# Named parameter can go anywhere in the url and are available in the 
# handler as part of the params hash. 

age_hash = {james: 23, amy: 34, bob: 45}

--------
get '/what/time/is/it/in/:number/:hours' do #  this is the same thing as :name
	number = params[:number].to_i
	time = Time.now + number * 3600
	"The time in #{number} hours will be #{time.strftime('%I:%M %p')}"
end

# understand what time is doing: 
# Time.now displays current time
# we can add seconds to Time.now hence the * 3600 (60 min * 60 sec)
### understand what .strftime is doing?
