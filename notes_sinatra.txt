# notes for sinatra: 

http: hypertext transfer protocol
	- allows communication over the internet bw clients and servers
	- client will request a resource from server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client. 
	- this response contains a status code, and the requested resource (usually a web page)

	these are sent via http. 

sinatra is a ruby application in 2000 LOC. 
	good study to understand how it works, and understand ruby better. 

sinatra is build on top of Rack > which is a low-level interface that communicates bw/ an http server and a ruby object. 

(other riby web frameworks: rails, ramaze, rango, camping, halcyon)

## if you can build it in ruby, you can make it into a sinatra app. 
is this ^ statement true?

## only the last line is evaluated and sent to the browser. (the line before 'end' that is)

## restarting the server after every change to existing files can be tiresome, so it's worth it to use Sinatra::Reloader which is part of the Sinatra::Contrib library. 

>> to use Sinatra::Reloader, install the sinatra-contrib gem.
